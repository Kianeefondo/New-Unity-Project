# Pacman on Android

**Pacman** is the fun old arcade game you used to see everywhere. Using a few guides, I was able to convert it into an android app which uses Swipe Detectors in order to successfully play Pacman on an android.

##How to play:

Basic Swipes will let you move pacman in different directions:
- Swipe Up to change direction going up
- Swipe Down to change direction going down
- Swipe Left to change direction going left
- Swipe Right to change direction going right

## Version Descriptions

V1.0:

## Notes & Bugs

- Swipe Trail Renderer is below the obsticle, pellets and Pacman layer.
- Ghosts will get stuck in some parts of the Level map.
- When passing through the passage, ghosts will change direction due to a change in distance to pacman.
